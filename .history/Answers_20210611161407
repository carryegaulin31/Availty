1.	Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can also be a personal or school project.  

I would have to say to date, in this(development) industry, it would be the hackathon I participated in for the non-profit community.
I took a giant determined leap of faith deciding to learn a new career in a world of the unknown. More unknown than I could even know I did not know at the time.
I spent twenty intense weeks learning everything I was given and anything that I could get my hands on and then it all came the end.  Now what?
I was fresh out of my boot camp and no clue what was to come.  I decided to immediately hop out of my comfort zone and put these new skills to the test and join a hackathon for Boston's nonprofit community.  I did it on my own, however, I had developed many tight friendships within my cohort and convinced two of my former fellow students, some reluctantly, to join me on this adventure.
Fortunately, two strangers that were majoring in business through the university hosting the hackathon and had not a tech bone in their bodies snatched us up as a package deal.  Oh boy, we were fresh, hope they did not expect to win.
Fast forward 48 hours later we had all become friends, developed a mobile MVP from idea to fruition, helped a cause that was beyond worthy and won a top prize. Not to mention a huge confidence boost for every single one of us.  The Boston Police Teen Academy won $2000 towards their program helping inner city kids stay happy, mentally healthy, emotionally supported, and productive in the summer months.
I stayed up for a substantially long time and single handedly created the entire backend for this project.  Server, API, Client the works.  Unfortunately, I had to go back and do some reengineering for it to easily cross over to React native for it to be a mobile app.  BUT that was OK.  I did it, that was all that mattered to me in that moment and I demonstrated to myself that I could accomplish when I set my mind to it and that I have what it takes to keep moving forward.
If anyone would have told me 5 months prior to that event that was going to happen I would have truly admired their optimism and appreciated their overzealous faith in me. So, at that moment after maybe 6 broken hours of sleep in 48 hours, that so far, has been my proudest moment/accomplishment so far and that is just the beginning.
