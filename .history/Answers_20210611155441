1.	Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can also be a personal or school project.  

I would have to say to date, in this particular field, it would be the hackathone I participated in for the non-profit community.
I took a giant determined leap of faith deciding to learn a new career in a world of the unknown. More unknown then I even could know I didn't know at the time.
I spent 20 intense weeks learning everything I was given and anything that I could get my hands on and then came the end.  Now what?
I was fresh out of my boot camp and no clue what was to come.  I decided to immediately hop out of my comfort zone and join a hackathon for Boston's non profit community.  
I did it on my own, however, I had developed many tight friendships within my cohort and convinced two of them to join in the adventure.
Fortunately two strangers that managed in business and had not a tech bone in thier body snatched us up.  Oh boy, we were fresh, hope they didn't want to win.
Fast forward 48 hours later we had all become friends, developed a mobile MVP from idea to fruition, helped a cause that was beyond worthy and won a top prize.
